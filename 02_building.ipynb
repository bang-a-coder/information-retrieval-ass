It was tested for reliability and validity in students and back pain patients. Principal components factor analysis of the subscales of the UCL and DMI in the student sample revealed two coping clusters: \"Instrumental mastery-oriented coping\" and \"Emotion-focused coping\" and two defensive clusters: \"Cognitive defense\" and \"Defensive hostility\". \"Instrumental mastery-oriented coping\" was negatively related to subjective health complaints measured with Ursins Health Inventory (UHI). The back pain patients were clearly different from the students, using less coping and more defensive strategies. They had more subjective health complaints that showed negative correlations with \"Instrumental mastery-oriented coping\".

Drageset S, Lindstrøm TC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Relationships between anxiety, social support, coping, and defence, in connection to mental health, were studied among patients with suspected breast cancer, awaiting diagnosis. Data were collected by questionnaires from 117 women, 25-76 years of age (mean: 53.6 years) who had undergone breast biopsy. Instruments used were: the Social Provisions Scale (SPS); the state scale of State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI); and CODE [based on the Utrecht Coping List (UCL) and Defence Mechanisms Inventory (DMI)]. The results showed that patients reported elevated levels of anxiety and high levels of social support. Yet, anxiety was strongest and negatively related to 'instrumental coping', followed by 'cognitive defence'. 'Defensive hostility' was unrelated to anxiety. Unexpectedly, 'emotion-focused coping' and social provisions were unrelated to anxiety. Social provisions were somewhat related to 'instrumental coping', but sparsely related to 'emotion-focused coping', unrelated to 'cognitive defence' and partly negatively related to 'defensive hostility'. Hence, social support and 'emotion-focused coping' did not in themselves repress anxiety. 'Instrumental coping' did, even in a situation where nothing could be done. Social support is suggested to be the product of an 'instrumental coping style', not necessarily contributing to it. Clinical consequences for professional information and support to patients with different coping styles are suggested.</em></small><br>[ID: 12887631]"

Understanding their relationship could inform treatment approaches to improve participation. We investigated the relationship between social cognition and participation in the long term after stroke. Of 395 patients participating in a large prospective cohort study, cross-sectional data were available at 3-4 years post-stroke of 118 patients on tests for emotion recognition, theory of mind, empathy, and behaviour regulation. Participation was assessed with the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation - Participation (USER-P). Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between social cognitive domains and participation. The majority suffered from minor stroke (83.1% scored NIHSS 0-4). Only behaviour regulation was related to participation restrictions in bivariate analysis, but social cognitive impairments did not predict participation restrictions in multivariate regression in this group. To conclude, in a sample of minor stroke patients with mild impairments in theory of mind, emotion recognition and behavioural control, there were no associations with restrictions in participation. Research should examine whether a relationship is present in patients with more severe stroke. In addition, measuring social aspects of participation is necessary to further unravel this relationship, to determine treatment targets for improving participation.</em></small><br>[ID: 31854264]"

Xie F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Employing a sequential mixed-methods design, the current study examined the role of Chinese EFL teachers' emotion regulation and resilience in predicting their work engagement. To this end, 314 Chinese EFL teachers with various academic degrees and teaching experiences were opted from different schools, institutes, and universities of China. To obtain the quantitative data, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were electronically distributed among participants. Performing correlational analyses, a strong association was found between teacher resilience and work engagement. The inspection of the correlations also revealed a moderate correlation between cognitive reappraisal and resilience as well as cognitive reappraisal and work engagement. To probe the predictability power of teacher resilience and emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal), structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed. The results of the SEM analysis demonstrated that Chinese EFL teachers' work engagement was predicted significantly and favorably by their resilience. Using semi-structured interviews, some qualitative data were also collected to fully understand Chinese EFL teachers' perceptions of work engagement. The thematic analysis (TA) of Chinese EFL teachers' responses to interview questions resulted in two main themes and 14 sub-themes, revealing extrinsic and intrinsic factors contributing to teaching engagement. The findings of TA illuminated that both personal resources and job resources can predict teaching engagement. The pedagogical implications for administrators and teacher trainers are further discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 34512487]"
